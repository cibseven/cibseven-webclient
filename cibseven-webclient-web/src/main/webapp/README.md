# Webapp Folder

This folder contains the build output from the frontend application. 

## Important Notes
- The contents of this folder are automatically generated by running the `npm run build` command from the `frontend` directory.
- **Do not modify this folder manually**. Any changes should be made in the `frontend` folder, and then the build process will regenerate the necessary files here.
- Any manual modifications to this folder will be overwritten the next time the `npm run build` command is run.

Please ensure that changes are only made in the appropriate frontend files, and the build process will propagate the changes to this folder.
