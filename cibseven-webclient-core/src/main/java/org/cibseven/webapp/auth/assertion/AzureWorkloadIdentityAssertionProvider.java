/**
 * <p>Supplies a federated identity token for Azure Workload Identity authentication.</p>
 *
 * <p>Azure Workload Identity injects a file containing a short-lived service account token
 * (signed by the Kubernetes OIDC issuer) into the workload pod. This token can be exchanged
 * for an Azure Entra ID access token via the
 * {@code urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer} mechanism.</p>
 *
 * <p>The file path is read from the {@code AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE} environment variable,
 * which is injected automatically by the Azure Workload Identity mutating webhook. The file
 * is re-read on every {@link #getAssertion()} call because Azure rotates the token
 * periodically.</p>
 *
 * <p>Required environment variable:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE} — absolute path to the projected token file
 *       (e.g. {@code /var/run/secrets/azure/tokens/azure-identity-token})</li>
